# KMeansSemgentation

To run :

1. Git clone repo
<sh>https://github.com/Patrick-Erath/KMeansSemgentation.git</sh>

2. Cd into folder, and build project
<sh>gpp kmeans_tst.c</sh>

3. Run k-means on the image
<sh>./a.out</sh>
This runs k-means on the image "segment.jpg", and saves the segmented image as "data.txt". To view the segmented image we use the jupyernotebook, and compare to the built-in k-means function of sklearn to test accuracy.

4. Compare C-code to Python
Start the jupyter-noteboot: 
<sh>jupyternotebook</sh>
Open image-segmentation to view the image segmented by C-code
